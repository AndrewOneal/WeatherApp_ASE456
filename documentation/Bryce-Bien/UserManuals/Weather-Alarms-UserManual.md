# Weather Alarms User Manual

## Introduction

The Weather Alarms feature allows users to receive customized notifications for specific weather conditions such as temperature extremes, low visibility, or high wind speeds.

## How to use

To set up your weather alarms, navigate to the settings page (cog button on the top right of the screen), set your parameters for when you would like to be notified.

* Minimum Temperature
* Maximum Temperature
* Visibility
* Wind Speeds

After doing so, save your settings. If there are current weather conditions in your area that match your set parameters, a banner will appear at the top of the screen notifying you of the alert.
